# Tensor Operations in Deep Learning

Tensors are the backbone of deep learning, acting as the core data structures that power neural networks. They are multi-dimensional arrays that allow efficient representation and computation of data, making them essential for deep learning frameworks. Tensors facilitate operations such as transformations, indexing, broadcasting, and matrix computations, enabling neural networks to process and learn from vast amounts of data efficiently.

This repository provides two Colab notebooks that dive into essential tensor operations using TensorFlow 2.0 and PyTorch. Special focus is given to einsum operations and advanced tensor manipulations, which are vital for optimizing deep learning workflows.

### Why Tensors Matter in Deep Learning

Tensors are critical in deep learning because they:

Represent structured data efficiently for neural networks

Enable parallel computations on GPUs for faster training

Support automatic differentiation for backpropagation

Provide flexibility in handling high-dimensional data structures

Mastering tensor operations allows for better model optimization, faster computations, and improved neural network performance.
